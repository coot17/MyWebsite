<h1>M.A.K.</h1>

<p> Hi My name is Molly Krasser!</p>
<p>I find it much easier to debug</p>
<p> code on Scratch rather than</p>
<p> on Python. The project for</p>
<p>7/17/2017 proved to be a </p>
<p>reletively easy one and my</p>
<p> partner and I spent very</p>
<p>little time debugging our code</p>
<p>I really enjoy how straight</p>
<p>forward the python language is</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> .</p>
<p> .</p>

<p1>Core Four: </p1>

<p2>LOOPS </p2>
<p2> - A loop is a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached</p2>
<p2> - Example of loop code in python are: for loop - (for x in range(5): print(x)) while loop - (count = 0</p2>
<p2>while count < 5: print(count) (count += 1) </p2>
<p2> - An analogy for loops can be put into terms of a merry-go-round. Imagine the merry go round only does the loop while the ride has been turned on.
<p2> This type of reliance is true for loops as well. They only loop if a certain thing has triggered them to loop. Sometime the loops are completed and other times they go on until the user tells them to stop.</p2>

<p2>VARIABLES </p2>
<p2> - A variable is a storage location paired with an identifier, which contains some quantity of information reffered to as a value</p2>
<p2> - Example of a variable in python is: myint = 7: print(myint) - myint is now a variable.
<p2> - An analogy of a variable is - when you name a pet, you keep that name stored in your brain but you can change the name of your pet at anytime and remeber that instead.</p2>

<p2>CONDITIONALS </p2>
<p2> - A conditional statement is the same as an if - then statement. It gives users the ability to check if a program is functioning properly.</p2>
<p2> - Example of a conditional in python - temperature = float(input('What is the temperature? '))
    if temperature > 70:
        print('Wear shorts.')
    else:
        print('Wear long pants.')
    print('Get some exercise outside.')</p2>
<p2> - An analogy of a conditional is this - if someone tells you that if you do something for them the they reward you with something. Otherwise you will get nothing.</p2>
